# Create a new FORTRAN module in WRF-Chem
_Louis Marelle,  2023-05-23_

The following guide explains how to add a new FORTRAN module in the WRF-Chem model. As an example, we will explain the steps to add a new module that performs tracer emissions for the chem_opt option 14 (also called CHEM_TRACE2).

## 1) Create the module file in chem/

Create the module file. To follow WRF conventions the file name should begin with module\_, for example:

```chem/module_tracer_emiss.F ```

Write the module code in chem/module_tracer_emiss.F. The basic syntax for a FORTRAN module containing one subroutine is the following. Include a driver routine with a name ending in '\_driver', that will be the one called from outside the module.

```
MODULE module_tracer_emiss

CONTAINS

SUBROUTINE tracer_emissions_driver(<argument_list>)
<subroutine code>
END SUBROUTINE tracer_emissions_driver

END MODULE module_tracer_emiss
```

Try to follow the coding and comment styles of recent chem routines from the team, for example chem/module_seaspray_emis.F

## 2) Include the new module in the chem Makefile (chem/Makefile_org)

WRF-Chem needs to know that this new module has to be compiled and where to find it.
Add the module in the chem Makefile, chem/Makefile_org. Just add this line anywhere, ideally near similar modules. Be careful to respect the existing syntax (number of spaces, backslash, etc.)

```
        module_tracer_emiss.o             \
```

## 3) Call the new module’s driver from emissions_driver in WRF-Chem and add the module’s dependencies into chem/depend.chem

The new module’s drivers needs to be called from the WRF-Chem code in chem/. For example add the following line in an appropriate place in chem/emissions_driver.F (replacing <argument list> by your driver’s actual arguments).

```
CALL tracer_emissions_driver(<argument_list>)
```

If the module is only used for a specific option, for example the tracer option CHEM_TRACE2, add a check that this option is used:

```
IF(config_flags%chem_opt == CHEM_TRACE2) THEN
  CALL tracer_emissions_driver(<argument_list>)
ENDIF
```

In order to run this CALL instruction, emissions_driver needs to know what is the routine tracer_emissions_driver. At the beginning of the subroutine where the CALL line was written (here, the emissions_driver subroutine in chem/emissions_driver.F), tell emissions_driver to use the subroutine tracer_emissions_driver from module_tracer_emiss

```
USE module_tracer_emiss ONLY: tracer_emissions_driver
```

This also means that module_tracer_emiss.o needs to be compiled before emissions_driver. Tell the model that emissions_driver depends on module_tracer_emissions in the chem compilation dependencies file chem/depend.chem. In depend.chem, add the new module’s .o file name at the end of the emissions_driver dependency list:

```
emissions_driver.o: <existing dependencies> module_tracer_emiss.o
```
  
Also tell the model about the new module’s own dependencies. If you included no USE instructions in the new module code, the dependencies can be left blank. USE instructions for phys/, frame/ or share/ code can usually be ignored too since these will always be compiled before chem anyway.

```
module_tracer_emiss.o:
```

## 4) Recompile WRF-Chem
Recompile the code. Do not forget to ```./clean -a``` before compilation when adding a new module.
